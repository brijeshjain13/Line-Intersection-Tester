# Line-Intersection-Tester
The software (Windows Form Application) is programmed to intake 4 co-ordinates of the 2 line-segments whose intersection is to be determined. The software then uses the  built library method to analyze and answer accordingly to the end user. A couple of cases for the input are left to be involved.
